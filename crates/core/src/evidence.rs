//! Evidence graph nodes for the multi-agent pipeline.
//!
//! `EvidenceNode` is the contract between Pick (which executes tools and
//! builds the graph), the Validator Agent (which confirms or rejects nodes),
//! and the Report Agent (which renders the published report).
//!
//! The graph is additive: once a node exists it is never mutated by the
//! Red Team Agent. The Validator transitions its `validation_status` and
//! may append a `SeverityHistoryEntry` explaining any severity revision.
//! Every published finding carries a [`Provenance`] produced at tool
//! execution time — this is how a senior reviewer reproduces it.
